# Environment variables

Read before adding, renaming, or reading an environment variable.

- `.env.example` (committed) lists every variable **by name only** — never put a value in it. Real values live in `.env.local` (git-ignored) and on the hosting platform.
- Contentful: `CONTENTFUL_SPACE_ID`, `CONTENTFUL_ACCESS_TOKEN` (Content Delivery API token), optional `CONTENTFUL_ENVIRONMENT` (defaults to `master`). Server-only: never prefix them with `NEXT_PUBLIC_`.
- They are validated lazily on each call; a missing or malformed value fails as a `config` error naming the variable, never its value.
